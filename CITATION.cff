  icepyx is both a software library and a community composed
  of ICESat-2 data users, developers, and the scientific
  community. We are working together to develop a shared
  library of resources - including existing resources, new
  code, tutorials, and use-cases/examples - that simplify
  the process of querying, obtaining, analyzing, and
  manipulating ICESat-2 datasets to enable scientific
  discovery.
