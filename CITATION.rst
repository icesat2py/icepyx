Citing icepyx
=============

icepyx
------

This community and software is developed with the goal of supporting science applications.
Thus, our contributors (including those who have developed the packages used within icepyx)
and maintainers justify their efforts and demonstrate the impact of their work through citations.

If you have used icepyx in your work, please consider citing our library.
We encourage you to use a version-specific citation and DOI (available from `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/record/7729175>`_)
to improve reproducibility and let users know the state of the software at the time of your analysis.
