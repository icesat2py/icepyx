Virtual Meetings
----------------
Our team (developers, users, scientists, educators) consists primarily of volunteers.
We meet on an as-needed basis via Zoom to provide support, troubleshoot issues, and plan development and collaboration efforts.

Our meetings are open to all, with upcoming meeting information available via `Discourse <https://discourse.pangeo.io/c/science/icesat-2/16>`_, `GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx/discussions>`_, or by request.
The :ref:`QUEST (Query Unify Explore SpatioTemporal) <api_quest_ref>`  team meets weekly on Mondays to co-work on integrating additional sensors into the icepyx workflow. 
Please contact us if you are interested in joining the QUEST team.


Ongoing Efforts
----------------
In addition to the ongoing development of icepyx itself, the ICESat-2 community continues to grow through a number of related initiatives, workshops, and events:

* `CryoCloud <https://cryointhecloud.com/>`_
* `ICESat-2 Hackweeks <https://icesat-2.hackweek.io/>`_
