First ICESat-2 Cryospheric Hackweek at the University of Washington (June 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This June 2019 event resulted in the production of a series of `tutorials <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/ICESat2_hackweek_tutorials>`_,
developed primarily by members of the ICESat-2 Science Team and early data users,
aimed at educating the cryospheric community in obtaining and using ICESat-2 datasets.
During the actual Hackweek, teams of researchers and data scientists developed a series of interesting
`projects <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/projects_2019>`_ related to their interests/research.
Many of these resources were drawn from in the initial development of `icepyx`.

Projects
^^^^^^^^
Though in many cases preliminary, these `project repositories <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/projects_2019>`_ c
an provide useful starting points to develop effective cryospheric workflows where more formal examples and functionality have not yet been developed.

*Sea Ice*

- `Floes are Swell <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/Floes-are-Swell>`_

  - Calculate chord length (CLD) and lead width (LWD)

- `Segtrax <https://icesat2hackweek2019.slack.com/messages/CKQ08MBBR>`_

  - Create trajectories of sea ice motion (creates Python trajectory class)

*Glaciers and Ice Sheets*

- `Crackup <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/crackup>`_

  - Investigating small-scale features such as crevasses and water depth

- `GlacierSat2 <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/glaciersat2>`_

  - Constrain surface types (e.g. wet vs. dry snow) using ICESat-2 data over the Juneau Icefield, working towards looking at seasonal elevation changes

- `WaterNoice <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/WaterNoice>`_

  - Detection of hydrologic features (e.g. meltwater ponds, firn aquifer seeps, blue ice megadunes, icebergs, etc.) in ATL06 land ice product

- `SnowBlower/blowing snow <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/Snowblower>`_

  - Evaluate the blowing snow flag and look at blowing snow models

- `Cross-trak (xtrak) <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/xtrak>`_

  - Interpolation between ICESat-2 tracks
  - Create gridded elevation data from multiple ICESat-2 tracks

- `Ground2Float <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/ground2float>`_

  - Identify grounding zones using ICESat-2 data (using the slope-break method)

- `Topohack <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/topohack>`_

  - Resolve topography over complex terrain
