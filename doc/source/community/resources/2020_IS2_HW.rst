Second [Virtual] ICESat-2 Cryospheric Hackweek Facilitated by the University of Washington
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The `2020 ICESat-2 Cryospheric Science Hackweek <https://icesat-2hackweek.github.io/learning-resources/>`_ was the
first virtual Hackweek held by the University of Washington.
While originally planned as a five-day, in-person workshop, the event was shifted to a fully virtual/remote setting in light of
stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions in place to curb the spread of COVID-19.

To accomodate multiple time zones and limit the daily duration of online tutorial sessions, the event was spread out over the course of ten days.
The first week had three half-days of interactive tutorials/lectures.
The second week had four days that included some interactive tutorials/lectures and scheduled times where instructors were
available to help participants with a facilitated exploration of datasets and hands-on software development.


This June 2020 event resulted in the production of a series of `tutorials <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/2020_ICESat-2_Hackweek_Tutorials>`_,
developed by volunteer instructors and presented during the event.
During the actual Hackweek, teams of researchers and data scientists developed a series of interesting
`projects <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/projects_2020>`_ related to their interests/research.

Projects
^^^^^^^^
Though in many cases preliminary, these `project repositories <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/projects_2020>`_
can provide useful starting points to develop effective cryospheric workflows where more formal examples and functionality have not yet been developed.

- `icepyx <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/icepyx_team>`_

  - Contributions to icepyx included new example notebooks, packaging on Python Package Index, installation instructions, and automated code coverage reports.

*Sea Ice*

- `leading to phytoplankton <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/leading_to_phytoplankton>`_

  - Obtain and visualize coincident ICESat-2, Sentinal-2, and Argo Float data
  - Many members of this group still meet regularly (2 years out!) and are creating a template to add new coincident datasets to icepyx.
  - Group members (including newer members) contribute to icepyx as collaborative developers and code reviewers.

- `overcast <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/overcast>`_

  - Build tools to merge data and explore the effects of sea ice leads on clouds in the Arctic

*Glaciers and Ice Sheets*

- `Seasonal Snow <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/SeasonalSnow>`_

  - Compare ICESat-2 data with high resolution DEMs over complex (mountainous) terrain

- `unsupervised <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/surface_classification>`_

  - unsupervised surface classification of ATL03 photons

- `FirnAndMelt <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/FirnAndMelt>`_

- `CloudMask <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/CloudMask>`_

  - Fetch, classify, and label ICESat-2 data
  - Still an ongoing collaboration??

- `crossovers <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/crossovers>`_

  - processing of non-overlapping ICESat-2 tracks

- `surface_velocity <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/surface_velocity>`_

  - Infer surface ice velocity from repeat passes and across beams.
  - Continued work resulted in a poster at AGU Fall Meeting 2020

- `Assimilation <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/Assimilation>`_

  - Compare ICESat-2 elevations with multiple DEM raster data types.
  - Quantify errors and compare results regionally
  - Contributed additional authentication methods to icepyx and provided initial code for what eventually became the Visualization module.
