Fourth ICESat-2 Cloud Computing Hackweek at the University of Washington eScience Institute
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This August 2023 event produced a series of `tutorials <https://icesat-2-2023.hackweek.io/tutorials/index.html>`_,
developed by volunteer instructors and presented during the event.
A continuing focus of the event was considerations for cloud-native workflows
(such as cloud-optimized data) and
building skills around accessing ICESat-2 data in the cloud.
During the Hackweek, teams of attendees worked on
`projects <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/ICESat-2-Hackweek-2023/tree/main/book/projects/project_readmes>`_
related to their domain interests and learning goals.
