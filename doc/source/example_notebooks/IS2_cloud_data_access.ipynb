    "# ICESat-2 AWS cloud data access\n",
    "This notebook ({nb-download}`download <IS2_cloud_data_access.ipynb>`) illustrates the use of icepyx for accessing ICESat-2 data currently available through the AWS (Amazon Web Services) us-west2 hub s3 data bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "1. ICESat-2 data became publicly available on the cloud on 29 September 2022. Thus, access methods and example workflows are still being developed by NSIDC, and the underlying code in icepyx will need to be updated now that these data (and the associated metadata) are available. We appreciate your patience and contributions (e.g. reporting bugs, sharing your code, etc.) during this transition!\n",
    "2. This example and the code it describes are part of ongoing development. Current limitations to using these features are described throughout the example, as appropriate.\n",
    "3. You **MUST** be working within an AWS instance. Otherwise, you will get a permissions error."

An important difference, however, is how the available variables list is created. When reading a local file the variables module will traverse the entire file and search for variables that are present in that file. This method it too time intensive with the s3 data, so instead the the product / version of the data product is read from the file and all possible variables associated with that product/version are reporting as available. As long as you are using the NSIDC provided s3 paths provided via Earthdata search and the Query object these lists will be the same."

    "The slow load speed is a demonstration of the many steps involved in making cloud data actionable - the data supply chain needs optimized source data, efficient low level data readers, and high level libraries which are enabled to use the fastest low level data readers. Not all of these pieces fully developed right now, but the progress being made it exciting and there is lots of room for contribution!"
