    "In addition to the required parameters (CMRparams and reqparams) that are submitted with our order, for ICESat-2 data products we can also submit subsetting parameters to NSIDC.\n",
    "For a deeper dive into subsetting, please see our [Subsetting Tutorial Notebook](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/IS2_data_access2-subsetting.html), which covers subsetting in more detail, including how to get a list of subsetting options, how to build your list of subsetting parameters, and how to generate a list of desired variables (most datasets have more than 200 variable fields!), including using pre-built default lists (these lists are still in progress and we welcome contributions!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsetting utilizes the NSIDC's built in subsetter to extract only the data you are interested (spatially, temporally, variables of interest, etc.). The advantages of using the NSIDC's subsetter include:\n",
    "* easily reproducible downloads, particularly when coupled with an icepyx query object\n",
    "* smaller file size, meaning faster downloads, less storage required, and no need to subset the data on your own\n",
    "* still easy to go back and order more data/variables with the same or similar search parameters\n",
    "* no extraneous data means you can move directly to analysis and easily navigate your dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain subset parameters are specified by default unless `subset=False` is included as an input to `order_granules()` or `download_granules()` (which calls `order_granules()` under the hood). A separate, companion notebook tutorial covers subsetting in more detail, including how to get a list of subsetting options, how to build your list of subsetting parameters, and how to generate a list of desired variables (most products have more than 200 variable fields!), including using pre-built default lists (these lists are still in progress and we welcome contributions!).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the CMR and required parameters, default subset parameters can be built and viewed using `subsetparams`. Where an input spatial file is used, rather than a bounding box or manually entered polygon, the spatial file will be used for subsetting (unless subset is set to False) but not show up in the `subsetparams` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "icepyx also makes it easy to take advantage of the reformatting (e.g. file format conversion) options offered by NSIDC. These are covered in more detail in the [Subsetting Tutorial Notebook](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/IS2_data_access2-subsetting.html)."
