    "Subsetting utilizes the NSIDC's built in subsetter to extract only the data you are interested (spatially, temporally, variables of interest, etc.). The advantages of using the NSIDC's subsetter include:\n",
    "* easily reproducible downloads, particularly when coupled with an icepyx query object\n",
    "* smaller file size, meaning faster downloads, less storage required, and no need to subset the data on your own\n",
    "* still easy to go back and order more data/variables with the same or similar search parameters\n",
    "* no extraneous data means you can move directly to analysis and easily navigate your dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain subset parameters are specified by default unless `subset=False` is included as an input to `order_granules()` or `download_granules()` (which calls `order_granules()` under the hood). A separate, companion notebook tutorial covers subsetting in more detail, including how to get a list of subsetting options, how to build your list of subsetting parameters, and how to generate a list of desired variables (most products have more than 200 variable fields!), including using pre-built default lists (these lists are still in progress and we welcome contributions!).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the CMR and required parameters, default subset parameters can be built and viewed using `subsetparams`. Where an input spatial file is used, rather than a bounding box or manually entered polygon, the spatial file will be used for subsetting (unless subset is set to False) but not show up in the `subsetparams` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "icepyx also makes it easy to take advantage of the reformatting (e.g. file format conversion) options offered by NSIDC. These are covered in more detail in the [Subsetting Tutorial Notebook](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/IS2_data_access2-subsetting.html)."
