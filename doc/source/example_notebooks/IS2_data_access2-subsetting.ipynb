    "### _What is SUBSETTING anyway?_\n",
    "\n",
    "_Anyone who's worked with geospatial data has probably encountered subsetting. Typically, we search for data wherever it is stored and download the chunks (aka granules, scenes, passes, swaths, etc.) that contain something we are interested in. Then, we have to extract from each chunk the pieces we actually want to analyze. Those pieces might be geospatial (i.e. an area of interest), temporal (i.e. certain months of a time series), and/or certain variables. This process of extracting the data we are going to use is called subsetting._\n",
    "\n",
    "_In the case of ICESat-2 data coming from the NSIDC DAAC, we can do this subsetting step on the data prior to download, reducing our number of data processing steps and resulting in smaller, faster downloads and storage._"
