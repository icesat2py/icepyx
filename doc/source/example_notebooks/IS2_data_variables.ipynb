    "This notebook illustrates the use of icepyx for managing lists of available and wanted ICESat-2 data variables.\n",
    "The two use cases for variable management within your workflow are:\n",
    "1. During the data access process, whether that's via order and download (e.g. via NSIDC DAAC) or remote (e.g. via the cloud).\n",
    "2. When reading in data to a Python object (whether from local files or the cloud).\n",
    "\n",
    "A given ICESat-2 product may have over 200 variable + path combinations.\n",
    "icepyx includes a custom `Variables` module that is \"aware\" of the ATLAS sensor and how the ICESat-2 data products are stored.\n",
    "The module can be accessed independently, but is optimally used as a component of a `Query` object (Case 1) or `Read` object (Case 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates in detail how the `Variables` module behaves using a `Query` data access example.\n",
    "However, module usage is analogous through an icepyx ICESat-2 `Read` object.\n",
    "More detailed example workflows specifically for the [query](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/IS2_data_access.html) and [read](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/IS2_data_read-in.html) tools within icepyx are available as separate Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
