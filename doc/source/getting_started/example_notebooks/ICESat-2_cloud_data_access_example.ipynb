    "### Utilizing icepyx capabilities to enable cloud data access\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the use of icepyx for access ICESat-2 data currently available through the AWS (Amazon Web Services) us-west2 hub s3 data bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Caveats\n",
    "***Please do not contact us saying this does not work until you have read this section in detail***\n",
    "1. ICESat-2 data is not currently publicly available on the cloud (and will not likely be until at least the end of 2021). A limited subset is currently available in an s3 bucket to developers and beta testers who have been registered with NSIDC.\n",
    "2. This example and the code it describes are part of ongoing development. Current limitations to using these features are described throughout the example, as appropriate.\n",
    "3. You **MUST** be working within an AWS instance. Otherwise, you will get a permissions error.\n",
