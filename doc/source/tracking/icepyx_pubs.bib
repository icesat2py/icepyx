@article{Musthafa2022,
abstract = {Forests absorb atmospheric carbon and hence play a vital role in carbon sequestration and climate regulation. Recent research emphasizes developing technology and methods to understand the carbon sequestration potential in various forest ecosystems. Forest stand height estimation is one of the crucial parameters in allometry that estimates forest biomass. An attempt is made in this study to map forest stand height in tropical and sub-tropical forests in India using recently launched spaceborne LiDAR platforms Ice Cloud and Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI). A geostatistical kriging approach is used to interpolate the forest stand height, and the generated stand height surface is validated using ground truth samples. The results showed that GEDI data performed better with an RMSE of 3.99 m and 2.62 m in tropical forests than the ICESat-2 data, which showed an RMSE of 5.71 m and 5.08 m, respectively. A similar pattern was observed in sub-tropical forests where GEDI modelled stand height outperformed ICESat-2 modelled stand height. This analysis demonstrates the potential of existing spaceborne LiDAR platforms in interpolating forest stand height at different forest types. Also, the research emphasizes the necessity of a high density of LiDAR footprints spread in both across- and along-track directions for accurate interpolation of forest stand height.},

abstract = {The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission used laser altimetry measurements to determine changes in elevations of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as sea ice thickness distribution. These measurements have provided important information on the response of the cryopshere (Earth's frozen surfaces) to changes in atmosphere and ocean condition. ICESat operated from 2003 to 2009 and provided repeat altimetry measurements not only to the cryosphere scientific community but also to the ocean, terrestrial and atmospheric scientific communities. The conclusive assessment of significant ongoing rapid changes in the Earth's ice cover, in part supported by ICESat observations, has strengthened the need for sustained, high accuracy, repeat observations similar to what was provided by the ICESat mission. Following recommendations from the National Research Council for an ICESat follow-on mission, the ICESat-2 mission is now under development for planned launch in 2018. The primary scientific aims of the ICESat-2 mission are to continue measurements of sea ice freeboard and ice sheet elevation to determine their changes at scales from outlet glaciers to the entire ice sheet, and from 10s of meters to the entire polar oceans for sea ice freeboard. ICESat carried a single beam profiling laser altimeter that produced ~70m diameter footprints on the surface of the Earth at ~150m along-track intervals. In contrast, ICESat-2 will operate with three pairs of beams, each pair separated by about 3km cross-track with a pair spacing of 90m. Each of the beams will have a nominal 17m diameter footprint with an along-track sampling interval of 0.7m. The differences in the ICESat-2 measurement concept are a result of overcoming some limitations associated with the approach used in the ICESat mission. The beam pair configuration of ICESat-2 allows for the determination of local cross-track slope, a significant factor in measuring elevation change for the outlet glaciers surrounding the Greenland and Antarctica coasts. The multiple beam pairs also provide improved spatial coverage. The dense spatial sampling eliminates along-track measurement gaps, and the small footprint diameter is especially useful for sea surface height measurements in the often narrow leads needed for sea ice freeboard and ice thickness retrievals. The ICESat-2 instrumentation concept uses a low energy 532nm (green) laser in conjunction with single-photon sensitive detectors to measure range. Combining ICESat-2 data with altimetry data collected since the start of the ICESat mission in 2003, such as Operation IceBridge and ESA's CryoSat-2, will yield a 15+ year record of changes in ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness. ICESat-2 will also provide information of mountain glacier and ice cap elevations changes, land and vegetation heights, inland water elevations, sea surface heights, and cloud layering and optical thickness.}
