What's new in v0.3.1 (10 September 2020)
----------------------------------------

This is a summary of the changes in icepyx v0.3.1. See :ref:`release` for a full changelog
including other versions of icepyx. Note that during this time period we transitioned to master + development branches, with mandatory squash commits to the development branch from working branches in order to simplify the git history.


New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- allow data querying using tracks and cycles
- transition to use of `query` class object
- add Black pre-commit hook and flake8 for code formatting and style consistency
- created a development branch, enabling master to be the stable release branch
- add icepyx release to PyPI, thereby enabling non-dev installs with pip
- add code coverage badge for testing
- enable alternative Earthdata authentication with netrc
- automatically unzip downloaded files into a single directory
- save order IDs and enable restart of download for previously ordered data
- option to suppress order status emails from NSIDC
- display variables in a dictionary format
- overall, the variables class was overhauled: generalized, improved, and tested

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- update bounding box assertions to allow crossing dateline
- add try/except for gaierror
- automatically order polygon vertices properly for submission to CMR and NSIDC APIs
- fix index error due to NSIDC metadata changes
- skip straight to variable subsetting without needing to manually run data search first


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `icesat2data` class is deprecated. The existing functionality to search and obtain data has been migrated to the `query` class. A new class will be created for subsequent steps of working with data.
- inclusive flag for `variable.append` and `variable.remove` methods has been removed


Maintenance
^^^^^^^^^^^

- add PyPI building to Travis for new releases
- update class architecture diagram and add to documentation page
- refactor test suite into multiple modules


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- update and improve installation instructions (especially for Windows users)
- review and update all docstrings (including examples)
- move examples to top level directory for easy finding (and make development notebooks harder to find)
- create subsetting workflow example Jupyter noteobok
- improve explanations in introductory example notebook
- reorganized documentation structure to be more intuitive (and categorized)
