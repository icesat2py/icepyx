What's new in 1.3.0 (13 September 2024)
---------------------------------------

These are the changes in icepyx 1.3.0 See :ref:`release` for a full changelog
including other versions of icepyx.

.. warning::
    This is anticipated to be the last release in v1 of icepyx.

    NSIDC (the NASA DAAC that hosts ICESat-2 data) is transitioning their
    API endpoint from the on-premises EGI system to the cloud-based Harmony services.
    icepyx is being updated to access these new services; the only change users
    will experience concerns services that are no longer available (e.g. reformatting).

    The developers plan to use this version change to implement additional breaking
    changes concerning the Query module, transitioning it's functionality to use
    the earthaccess library instead.

    Find more details on all these changes, including their progress, on GitHub issues and discussions.
